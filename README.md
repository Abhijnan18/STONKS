## 1. Stock Watch

The Stock Watch program, implemented in Python, allows users to retrieve and view the past 5 days' closing prices for a company's shares in either the Indian (NSE) or US (NASDAQ) stock market. The program uses the `yfinance` library for fetching historical stock data and Pandas for data manipulation and display.

### Usage

1. **Menu-driven Interface:**
   - When you run the program, it presents a menu-driven interface to choose the stock market:
      - Enter `1` for the Indian Stock Market (NSE).
      - Enter `2` for the US Stock Market (NASDAQ).

2. **Input Company Information:**
   - After selecting the stock market, the program prompts the user to enter the company symbol.

3. **View Closing Prices:**
   - The program retrieves and displays the past 5 days' closing prices for the chosen company in a tabular format using Pandas.

4. **Save to CSV:**
   - The closing prices are saved to a CSV file named `{company_symbol}_{exchange}_closing_prices.csv`.

5. **Display Information:**
   - The chosen company name, symbol, and the table of closing prices are displayed.

6. **CSV File Location:**
   - The program informs the user about the location of the saved CSV file.
